  "description": "react-impact is a lightweight CLI prototype for scanning a React project and producing a first-pass dependency impact report. It is intentionally minimal right now: it walks a directory, collects `.js` and `.jsx` files, and outputs a placeholder analysis structure. The goal is to evolve this into a real impact-analysis tool for React build and deployment workflows.",
